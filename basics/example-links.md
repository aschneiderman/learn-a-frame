- [Louvre with fog](


    to understand this one you'll need to read about mixins





A whole lot of boxes:
https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/examples/primitives/boxes/index.html

Walls and shadows:


From A-Frame's main site examples page, here's some examples you might want to try to tweak:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/test/shadows/index.html
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/primitives/boxes/index.html
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aframevr/aframe/master/examples/test/fog/index.html

For each of these examples, copy the code and then play with it.  The first thing you
need to do is change the line that points to aframe.  It'll look something like this:
    <script src="../../../dist/aframe-master.js"></script>
 Change it to:
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.7.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
