# Getting Up to Speed Quickly

If you're joining Mixed Reality for All and you've never played with A-Frame, here's how you can quickly get up to speed.

## What Is A-Frame?  

- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a free, open source framework for creating virtual reality  -- and, soon, augmented reality -- sites on the Internet.  
- You  create A-Frame Pages using HTML and, for fancier stuff, JavaScript

##  How Do I Make an A-Frame Page?

- Watch this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDePTwGOWKY) on how create a basic page
- Go to this [very simple  A-Frame page](https://glitch.com/~af-hello-world) on Glitch.com.  Click **Preview** to see it in action on your web browser.  Use the arrow keys to move and your mouse to turn.
 - Click **Remix your own**  and  experiment with your copy of  the page.  To see the results,  click **Live** at the top of the page.

## How Do I Customize A-Frame?

One of the great things about A-Frame is that if you've had a little programming experience or are an "adventurous beginner," it's not that hard to customize it.

- Go to Mixed Reality for All's tutorial on [creating components](https://mr4all.github.io/learn-a-frame/coding/components/index.html) and read the first lesson on [creating a simple component](https://mr4all.github.io/learn-a-frame/coding/components/10-basic-component.html)
- Go to the lesson's sample code [on Glitch](https://glitch.com/~af-basic-component), click **Remix your own**  and experiment with it

And that's it!

## If You Have More Time

Have a little more time?  Here's how to go a little deeper
- Skim [Building a Basic Scene](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html),  A-Frame's intro tutorial.  It's a little geekier than the short intro video, but it's a good quick overview of the tricks you can do just using A-Frame HTML.
- To see what A-Frame can do, check out A-Frame's [list of examples](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/), which includes their [source code](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/examples) (on GitHub) so you can see how they did it.  Also check out the [Week of A-Frame](https://aframe.io/blog/) blog.
- Read the rest of the lessons on [creating components](https://mr4all.github.io/learn-a-frame/coding/components/index.html), and experiment with their code on Glitch
