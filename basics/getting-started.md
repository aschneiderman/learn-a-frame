## Learn A-Frame HTML

### 1) Learn The Basics

Start by watching the five short [intro to A-Frame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDePTwGOWKY) videos, created by [Upperline School of Code](https://www.upperlinecode.com/). A few things you'll need to know:

* After each tutorial, take a few minutes to try out what you learned. Start by making a copy of this [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr4all/learn-a-frame/master/templates/a-frame-template.html) or copy and tweak this  [Hello World example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr4all/learn-a-frame/master/templates/hello-world.html), located on Mixed Reality for All's [GitHub](https://github.com/mr4all) site.
*   The tutorial writes code using Amazon's online [Cloud 9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) service, but you don't have to. You could use another online service like [codepen](https://codepen.io/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Or you could write your code on your desktop/laptop's hard drive -- although if you do, make sure to back up your work (e.g., using [GitHub](https://github.com/)).
* To view what your code built, you're probably going to use a web browser  (e.g., Firefox or Google Chrome). To move around your AR/VR scene using a browser, use the arrow keys to move and your mouse to turn.  
*   The tutorial is partly based on the page, [Building a Basic Scene](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html), from A-Frame's documentation. The written version is much geekier than the YouTube tutorials, but you still might find it useful to skim it.

You'll also want to [learn about the A-Frame Inspector](https://aframe.io/docs/0.7.0/introduction/visual-inspector-and-dev-tools.html), which lets you visually manipulate objects on the screen -- and get the HTML for any changes you made!

<!-- If you have a little extra time, watch this recent, [short talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WaBESMWZ7g) by Martin Splitt (skip the first 5 minutes, on WebGL). Not only will you get a quick refresher of some of A-Frame's basics, you'll also learn a bunch of cool, very useful tricks and tips. -->

If you're feeling adventurous, try out A-Frame's [A-Frame School](https://aframe.io/aframe-school/#/) tutorial.  This tutorial goes at a faster clip and is geekier than the Upperline tutorials, but it covers a lot more material.  If it's too much for you right now, give it another try after Step 3.

### 2) Learn From Examples

Now that you've got your feet wet, it's time to start exploring:

*   A-Frame's main site has a bunch of [examples](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/); you can view their [source code](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/examples) on their GitHub site. Some of these examples are pretty straightforward, some are pretty tricky. Take a look at a few, find one or two you're pretty sure you understand, and experiment with a copy of their code.
*   Take a quick look at the [Week of A Frame](https://aframe.io/blog/) blog; this will give you a better idea of what's possible to do with A-Frame. If you're feeling adventurous, find an example or two you like and read their code to get an idea of how they did it.

NOTE:   If you click on an example and all you see is a blank screen, try using the arrow keys and the mouse to move around; some examples aren't displayed so they're in front of you if you're using a browser.

### 3) Skim the Documentation

Now that you've played around, it's time to check out the [documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/):

*  Skim through the list of topics, pick 1 or 2 that sound interesting, skim through their documentation 
* Don't worry if you don't understand everything they say: learn what you can, and think about how the experience could be improved for a beginner in the community
* If you have time, try out an idea or two -- e.g., if the documentation describes an option that's new to you, try using it
