## Class 1: Writing Components

[NOTE: break the written tutorial up into several pages/parts, so it isn't one long scroll. And then create what the sensory table contents, where we say here's what you're going to learn how to do] [then do a link to what you need to know first, prerequisites, on the learning HTML page]
[NOTE: just because you can code it doesn't mean you should; the range of things you can do just using HTML is pretty remarkable.
Maybe I need a page of things you can do with HTML that it might not occur to you that you can do -- or that you may have seen at one point but forgot about. Maybe it's a cheat sheet?


NOTE: in my outline for the session, have instructor's note:
Make sure everyone is comfortable reading HTML
Ask people about their experience using HTML with A-Frame so far, get a show of hands to see who has done so


(In written tutorial, where to mention version 0, which has no JavaScript?)
(Maybe just show it and say, our goal is to â€¦)

### 1) Basic Component

Example:  "3 Things Getting on My Nerves"

bugs-me-less

Make a word become slightly opaque

[NOTE: remind people about the debugger: with JavaScript and with HTML, if it breaks it won't tell you on the screen]

The hardest thing about getting used to programming in A-Frame isn't JavaScript if you don't know it. The hardest part
- Learning the APIs, conventions, etc.
- Learning the ideas behind them

For example, scale: looks weird because weight, 3D object? But remember, VR/AR is three-dimensional space.


Now you try it: Modify the Component

Try changing the color

### 2) Parameter
What you can't do with mixins: Passing a property: how much does it bug me?

### 3)  Clickable

### 4)  Clicking One Element Affects Another


NOTE: although uses JavaScript, that's not the part was the biggest learning curve. The big piece is learning the model, learning which components other people have created are worth using.

Ex:  subtracting from sale:  need vector 3(?)
