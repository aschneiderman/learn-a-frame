# Creating Components

One of the great things about A-Frame is that it's not too hard to customize if you're comfortable doing a little coding using Javascript or if
you have a little experience coding in another programming language.

Attributes are a critical part of HTML. For example, let's say you create a box:

```js
<a-box position="-.75 0.5 -3"  color="purple" shadow></a-box>
```
position, color, and shadow are attributes that describe how and where the box should be created.  In these lessons we'll learn how to make custom HTML attributes by creating components.

<!-- ### Creating Custom Primitives A.K.A. HTML Tags -->

<!-- Not only can you create HTML attributes, you can also create your own HTML tags, called primitives. These lessons will show you how.
