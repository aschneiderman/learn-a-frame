### Creating Components

One of the great things about A-Frame is that it's not too hard to customize it if you're comfortable doing a ittle coding in Javascript.  In these lessons we'll learn how to add custom HTML attributes called components.

Each lesson has 4 links that let you read the **tutorial**, view the **code** described in the tutorial, see a **demo** of the code, and play with the code in your browser using **Glitch**.com
